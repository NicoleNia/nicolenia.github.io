    <h1>What’s Inside The Mystery Black Box?
</h1>
    <h2>Claim</h2>
    <p>Mr. Sinusas’s Black Box has more than two collection buckets/containers/bottles emptying at different times. 

</p>
    <h2>Evidence</h2>
    <p>Mr. Sinusas’s Black Box is a long black container with a funnel on top and a tube on the bottom. When water goes in through the funnel, a second passes before the water comes trickling out. Almost always there is less than the original amount poured in, but sometimes there is no water that comes out, or a bunch of water that comes out. 
</p>
    <p>The Black Box we built had three buckets connected to each other by tubes, the top bucket being the receiving, and the bottom two buckets being the collectors. We always had less water coming out than going in after the first trial, when we put in 500 mL and got 0 mL out.
