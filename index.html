      <h2>Claim</h2>
       <p>Mr. Sinusas’s Black Box has more than <strong>two</strong> collection buckets/containers/bottles emptying at different times. 

</p>
     </div>

       <h2>Evidence</h2>
       <p>Mr. Sinusas’s Black Box is a long black container with a funnel on top and a tube on the bottom. When water goes in through the funnel, a second passes before the water comes trickling out. Almost always there is less than the original amount poured in, but sometimes there is no water that comes out, or a bunch of water that comes out. 
</p>
    <p>The Black Box we built had three buckets connected to each other by tubes, the top bucket being the receiving, and the bottom two buckets being the collectors. We always had less water coming out than going in after the first trial, when we put in 500 mL and got 0 mL out.
</p>

     <div>
       <h2>Reasoning Pt.1</h2>
       <p>In our investigation we designed a model based on the Black Box. According to Merriam Webster, a model is “a three-dimensional representation of a person, thing or proposed structure, typically on a smaller scale than the original.” Models can be made from anything, whether it's a computer, cardboard boxes, or popsicle sticks. 

</p>
       <h2>Reasoning Pt.2</h2>
       <p>The Black Box must have more than two collection containers that empty at different times because based on our observations, a Black Box without three+ containers would eliminate the chance of a larger output than input, or no output.

</p>
       <h2>Reasoning Pt.3</h2>
       <p>If the Black Box had two collection systems emptying at the same time, then there would always be the same output as input coming out everytime. If there were altercations, the output may be less than the input occasionally, but there would never be no output or a larger output than input. In our Black Box we never saw a larger input than output, but we saw no output once; therefore, having three containers was closer to the original Black Box than having two containers.
